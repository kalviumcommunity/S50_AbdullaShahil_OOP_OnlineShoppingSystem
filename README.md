## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C++

## OOP Concepts Application

- **Classes and Objects**
  - Implement classes such as `User`, `Product`, `Cart`, and `Order` to encapsulate data and behaviors.

- **Inheritance**
  - Use inheritance for specialized types of users or products (e.g., `PremiumUser` inheriting from `User`).

- **Polymorphism**
  - Apply polymorphism for different payment methods or shipping options derived from a base class.

- **Encapsulation**
  - Encapsulate data within classes, providing controlled access through public methods and hiding internal details.

- **Abstraction**
  - Abstract complex implementation details, offering a simplified interface for user interactions with the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C++

## OOP Concepts Application

- **Classes and Objects**
  - Implement classes such as `Customer`and `Product` to encapsulate data and behaviors.

- **Inheritance**
  - Allows further inheritance specialization for types of customers or products (e.g., `PremiumUser` inheriting from `Customer`).

- **Polymorphism**
  - Can apply polymorphism for different payment methods or shipping options derived from a base class.

- **Encapsulation**
  - Encapsulate data within classes, providing controlled access through public methods and hiding internal details.

- **Abstraction**
  - Abstract complex implementation details, offering a simplified interface for user interactions with the system.
